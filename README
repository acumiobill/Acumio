This project is for building an Acumio Metadata server and associated
client libraries as well as a command-line utility for exercising the
client libraries. At the time of this writing, both server and client
are written in C++, though the eventual plan is to support a Java
based client as well as a Node.js client. It is unclear if we will
maintain a C++ client.

There are a few prerequisites for this process to work:

	* Google's protobuf libraries - specifically proto3
		* Currently, C++ and Java generation are required.
		* The Java libraries require JDK 1.6, but we will
		  need JDK 1.8 support anyway for SSL support in grpc.
		* Later, we will need the JavaScript libraries.
	* Google's grpc libraries
		* Currently, C++ libraries are required.
		* Later, we will additionally need to be able to generate
		  Java versions, and in order to support SSL/TSL, this will
		  require JDK 1.8.
		* Later, we will also need to be able to generate node.js
		  libraries.
	* An SSL Certificate. (NOT YET ENABLED).
		* For testing purposes, this can be self-signed, but we will
		  later need to get "real" ones signed from a CA signing
		  authority.
		* Getting CA signed certificates takes between minutes and
		  hours from the signing authority. For this reason, Acumio
		  will later want to become our own signing authority so
		  that we can issue certificates for our installations in
		  an automated fashion.
		* When installing certificates, it's helpful to know that
		  these typically live in /etc/ssl/certs (public key) and
		  /etc/ssl/private (private key). However, the private
		  keys are only readable by either root or members of
		  the unix group ssl-cert (at least on Ubuntu). So either,
                  the user that the Acumio server runs as has to be a member
                  of ssl-cert, or the files have to be copied (securely!)
                  somewhere that the Acumio server can read.


Installation instructions for Google's protobuf libraries is found here:
    https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases
Installation for Google's grpc libraries is found here:
    https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/release-0_11/INSTALL.
Installation instructions for SSL Certificates (assumes Ubuntu machine):
    https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/certificates-and-security.html

Assuming these requirements are met, it should then be possible to build
and deploy both client and server. The overall directory structure will
look something like this:

   apiprotos/
       Makefile
       {other stuff}
   AcumioServer/
       Makefile
       {other stuff}
   AcumioClient/
       Makefile
       {other stuff}

You can build using the provided Makefiles. You will need to first build
the apiprotos libraries. After the apiprotos are built, you can build
the AcumioServer and the AcumioClient in either order.

The output of the AcumioServer's Makefile is an executable:
    AcumioServer.exe
The output of the AcumioClient's Makefile is a set of libraries and an
executable:
    AcumioCommandLine.exe

If all goes well, you should be able to first start the AcumioServer.exe
by invoking it directly, then invoke the AcumioCommandLine.exe.
